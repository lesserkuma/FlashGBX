## Installing and running

### Pre-compiled binaries and packages

Available in the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/lesserkuma/FlashGBX/releases) section are pre-compiled downloads available for:

* **Windows (64-bit)**
  * Setup: An installer that will add the application to the start menu and optionally create a desktop icon
  * Portable: Have everything in one place including the config files
  
  *(For users of Windows 7, legacy “Qt5” versions are provided as well.)*

* **Linux**
  * Ubuntu (.deb file): Install using `dpkg -i /path/to/FlashGBX_x.x_Ubuntu-all.deb`.<br>*(Based on a contribution by [JJ-Fox](https://github.com/JJ-Fox))*
  * Other distributions: Pre-made packages are contributed by JJ-Fox [here](https://github.com/JJ-Fox/FlashGBX-Linux-builds/releases/latest).

* **macOS**
  * x86-64/arm64 (.dmg file): Install by opening the .dmg file and copying over the “FlashGBX” application to the desktop.<br>If it doesn’t run, it probably got quarantined during download. Run the following command in a Terminal window to unquarantine it: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/FlashGBX.app`.<br>*(Based on a contribution by [Cliffback](https://github.com/Cliffback))*

  *(If you have a Joey Jr and use macOS, please run the [Joey Jr Firmware Updater](https://github.com/lesserkuma/JoeyJr_FWUpdater) before using FlashGBX.)*

### Run via Python

FlashGBX can also be run in a Python environment like so:

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.10.11 is recommended)
2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt window
3. Install FlashGBX with this command:<br>`pip3 install "FlashGBX[qt6]"`
* If installation fails, try this command instead:<br>`pip3 install "FlashGBX[qt5]"`
* If installation still fails, you can install the minimal version (command line interface) with this command:<br>`pip3 install FlashGBX`
* Update to the latest version by replacing `install` with `install -U`.

#### Running
Use this command in a Terminal or Command Prompt window to launch the installed FlashGBX application:

`python3 -m FlashGBX`

*FlashGBX should work on pretty much any operating system that supports Qt-GUI applications built using [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/) or [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/), [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/), [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/), [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/), [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [python-dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/) packages. To run FlashGBX in portable mode without installing, you can also download the source code archive and call `python3 run.py` after installing the prerequisites yourself.*

*Note: On Linux systems, the `brltty` module may render serial communication devices non-accessible. See the troubleshooting section for details.*

Many different reproduction cartridges share their flash chip command set, so even if yours is not on this list, it may still work fine or even be auto-detected as another one. Support for more cartridges can also be added by creating external config files that include the necessary flash chip commands.

*¹ = Cannot always be auto-detected, select cartridge type manually*

### Troubleshooting

* If something doesn’t work as expected, first try to clean the game cartridge contacts (best with IPA 99.9%+ on a cotton swab) and reconnect the device. An unstable cartridge connection is the most common reason for read or write errors.

* If your Game Boy Camera cartridge is not reading, make sure it’s connected the correct way around; screws go up.

* For save data backup/restore on Game Boy Advance reproduction cartridges, depending on how it was built, you may have to manually select the save type for it to work properly. However, the save data backup/restore feature may not work on certain reproduction cartridges with batteryless-patched ROMs. As those cartridges use the same flash chip for both ROM and save data storage, a full ROM backup will usually include the save data. Also, when flashing a new unpatched ROM to a cartridge like this, the game may not be able to save progress without soldering in a battery. See the [Flash Cart DB website](https://flashcartdb.com/index.php/Clone_and_Repo_Cart_Problems) for more information.

* Depending on your system configuration, you may have to use `pip` and `python` commands instead of `pip3` and `python3`.

* On some Linux systems, you may run into a *Permission Error* problem when trying to connect to USB devices without *sudo* privileges. To grant yourself the necessary permissions temporarily, you can run `sudo chmod 0666 /dev/ttyUSB0` (replace with actual device path) before running the app. For a permanent solution, add yourself to the usergroup that has access to serial devices by default (e.g. *dialout* on Debian-based distros; `sudo adduser $USER dialout`) and then reboot the system.

* On some Linux systems, you may need the *XCB Xinerama package* if you see an error regarding failed Qt platform plugin initialization. You can install it with `sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0` etc. It was reported that this additional command is required on MX Linux: `sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb-util.so.0.0.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb-util.so.1`

* On some Linux systems like Fedora, you may need to install the `python3-pillow-qt` package manually in order for the GUI mode to work.

* On some Linux systems you may see the message “No devices found.” with the GBxCart RW or GBFlash hardware device, even though you’re using a USB cable capable of data transfers. This may be caused by a module called `brltty` (a driver for refreshable braille displays) that is erroneously interfering and taking over control of any connected USB device that uses the CH340/341 chipset. The solution would be to uninstall or blacklist the `brltty` driver and then reboot the system. This is not an issue with Joey Jr devices.

* If you’re using macOS version 10.13 or older, there may be no driver for serial communication devices installed on your system. You can either upgrade your macOS version to 10.14+ or manually install a driver which is available [here](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver).

* If you’re using macOS and get a “Segmentation Fault: 11.” error, try the “Run using Python” method with Python version 3.10.11.

## Miscellaneous

* To use your own frame around extracted Game Boy Camera pictures, place a file called `pc_frame.png` (must be at least 160×144 pixels) into the configuration directory. (GUI mode only)

* To write only the differences between two ROMs, name the original one `<name>.gba` and the edited one `<name>.delta.gba`.
